# TaskTails
***Overview: Gamification of chores and tasks. This was initially created for OMSCS Hackathon 2024, but I wanted to continue developing the idea into something more.***

#### What is this application?
- Simply put, this application pairs a task tracker with a virtual pet simulator.
- By creating, prioritizing, then completing your tasks you will earn Task Tokens and Pet Experience to hatch and level your pet.
- Your save file, which will include your tasks and relevant pet data, will all be stored on your local machine.
- No microtransactions, no privacy concerns, a completely free task tracker with a virtual pet that can be ran offline. 

#### What are Task Tokens?
- Task Tokens are a currency created for this application that can be used to buy care items for your pet to keep it happy.
- You will earn Task Tokens based on the priority of each task completed, and potentially how quickly you completed it ahead of the deadline.
- Consider the Tokens as a way to take a break from working on tasks and relax a few minutes with your new virtual pet. 

#### How can I use Task Tokens?
- Currently a work in progress, but the idea is to have a shop menu to buy a few items such as food, grooming, and toys to raise your pets happiness.

#### What do the pets look like?
- Current eggs are placeholders and will be replaced with art I have created and example images will be updated here at a later time.

#### Can I have more than one pet?
- Yes! The idea is to let users have multiple save files to have multiple pets.
- Future ideas include allowing users to fully evolve their pet and get a new one, have multiple tabs for sorting tasks which would allow multiple pets, and whatever else gets updated here later. 

#### When will this be completed?
- I cannot provide an exact date or even a timeframe. This is a side project I am working on in my spare time and it will be updated in short bursts to avoid burnout, though I am hoping to have a mostly working prototype in the near future.

#### Can I fork/clone this repo?
- Sure! You can even change the pets! This project will remain free and open-sourced.
